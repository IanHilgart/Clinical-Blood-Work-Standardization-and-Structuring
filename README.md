# Clinical-Blood-Work-Standardization-and-Structuring
This script will standardize healthcare lab test names which often have multiple names for the same test. 
It will also average values for identical lab tests that occur on the same day.

To use the script you will need to download the healthcare lab test dictionary, which is included. 
The dictionary is very comprehensive but still incomplete. 
If you are so inclined please update the standardized names and add the updated file to the repository.
